# Project 6 - *TranslateMe*

Submitted by: **Lou Salvant**

**TranslateMe** is an app that allows users to input text, select source and target languages, and receive translations using the MyMemory API.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [x] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [x] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [x] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [x] Add UI flair

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I faced challenges with inconsistent API responses, text encoding issues, and ensuring accurate translations. I also improved the UI for better readability and managed the translation state to display the progress view correctly. Additionally, I filtered translation matches to present the most accurate results to the user.
